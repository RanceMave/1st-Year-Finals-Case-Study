Instructions for the code

 The constructor allows the user to set the status of the student as “Regular” or “Irregular”.
 Make sure that the method setGender()only accepts ‘M’ and ‘F’ as code. Allow the user to be
notified about an invalid input and re-allow the user to set the gender.
 Make sure that the method setLevel()only accepts ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘4’, and ‘5’ as levels. Allow the
user to be notified about an invalid input and re-allow the user to set the level.
 The assist data field will have a value as the level of the student is known. Assume that the
assist for level ‘1’ is P 100, ‘2’ is P150, ‘3’ is P200, ‘4’ is P250, and ‘5’ is P300.
 In the print() method, allow the user to see the full information of the student: its student ID,
status, full word for gender as ‘M’ for MALE, and ‘F’ for FEMALE. Also, allow the user to see
the full word of the level, as ‘1’ Freshman, ‘2’ Sophomore, ‘3’ Junior, ‘4’ Senior, and ‘5’ ‘Fifth
Year and Beyond’.
 In testing the class, create an object of the Student class.
